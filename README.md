## Progress
* Designed and brainstormed the architecture of the web service
* created and configured the basic settings of the Spring Boot project (lombok, spring boot starter kit, gradle version, etc...)
* HelloController, HelloResponseDto implemented
* JUnit, MockMvc, SpringRunner.class testing for basic api / mapping functionality
* Began constructing Posts Entity class 

## Next step

## Problems faced
* A getter is not created for one boolean field in Posts class (i.e. completed). 
  * could it be about primitive vs. object reference variables?
